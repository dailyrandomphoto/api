Itâ€™s often called the Sadr region as the bright glowing star is officially called Gamma Cygni but commonly referred to as Sadr. Some people confuse it with the butterfly ðŸ¦‹ nebula, given its distinct looking features somewhat resembling the wings of a butterfly however that is another object. The Gamma Cygni nebula is full of ionised hydrogen, oxygen and sulphur and is one of the brightest regions in our galaxy. This object required 17,700 seconds of exposure to be revealed with an Astro-modded dslr camera.","alt_description":"a very large star cluster in the sky","breadcrumbs":[],"urls":{"raw":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1693900269364-d99aa0385c8e?ixid=M3w3NzUwOHwwfDF8cmFuZG9tfHx8fHx8fHx8MTY5NjAzMzY0Mnw&ixlib=rb-4.0.3","full":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1693900269364-d99aa0385c8e?crop=entropy&cs=srgb&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w3NzUwOHwwfDF8cmFuZG9tfHx8fHx8fHx8MTY5NjAzMzY0Mnw&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=85","regular":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1693900269364-d99aa0385c8e?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w3NzUwOHwwfDF8cmFuZG9tfHx8fHx8fHx8MTY5NjAzMzY0Mnw&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080","small":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1693900269364-d99aa0385c8e?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w3NzUwOHwwfDF8cmFuZG9tfHx8fHx8fHx8MTY5NjAzMzY0Mnw&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=400","thumb":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1693900269364-d99aa0385c8e?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w3NzUwOHwwfDF8cmFuZG9tfHx8fHx8fHx8MTY5NjAzMzY0Mnw&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=200","small_s3":"https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images.unsplash.com/small/photo-1693900269364-d99aa0385c8e"},"links":{"self":"https://api.unsplash.com/photos/a-very-large-star-cluster-in-the-sky-okxqeyvAArU","html":"https://unsplash.com/photos/a-very-large-star-cluster-in-the-sky-okxqeyvAArU","download":"https://unsplash.com/photos/okxqeyvAArU/download?ixid=M3w3NzUwOHwwfDF8cmFuZG9tfHx8fHx8fHx8MTY5NjAzMzY0Mnw","download_location":"https://api.unsplash.com/photos/okxqeyvAArU/download?ixid=M3w3NzUwOHwwfDF8cmFuZG9tfHx8fHx8fHx8MTY5NjAzMzY0Mnw"},"likes":181,"liked_by_user":false,"current_user_collections":[],"sponsorship":null,"topic_submissions":{"monochromatic":{"status":"approved","approved_on":"2023-09-07T10:29:31Z"}},"user":{"id":"xLrQ4u8qZU0","updated_at":"2023-09-29T09:40:23Z","username":"deep_sky_prints","name":"Anders Drange","first_name":"Anders","last_name":"Drange","twitter_username":null,"portfolio_url":"http://Deepskyprints.com","bio":"I'm an astrophotographer by passion based in the light polluted skies of Copenhagen, Denmark.
