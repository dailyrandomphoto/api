R. R. Tolkien novel is in reality the natural phenomenon of Horsetail Fall at Yosemite National Park. In February each year for about two weeks, the angle of the setting sun, along with the shadow from El Capitan, come to the edge of the falls and set it ablaze. I met people who had been chasing the Firefall for years so I feel very lucky to have arrived when the conditions were perfect.","alt_description":"photography of mountain cliff during daytime","urls":{"raw":"https://images.unsplash.com/flagged/photo-1575556809963-3d9e5730eda0?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjc3NTA4fQ","full":"https://images.unsplash.com/flagged/photo-1575556809963-3d9e5730eda0?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=85&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=srgb&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjc3NTA4fQ","regular":"https://images.unsplash.com/flagged/photo-1575556809963-3d9e5730eda0?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjc3NTA4fQ","small":"https://images.unsplash.com/flagged/photo-1575556809963-3d9e5730eda0?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=400&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjc3NTA4fQ","thumb":"https://images.unsplash.com/flagged/photo-1575556809963-3d9e5730eda0?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=200&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjc3NTA4fQ"},"links":{"self":"https://api.unsplash.com/photos/ttJ-qnuboak","html":"https://unsplash.com/photos/ttJ-qnuboak","download":"https://unsplash.com/photos/ttJ-qnuboak/download","download_location":"https://api.unsplash.com/photos/ttJ-qnuboak/download"},"categories":[],"likes":509,"liked_by_user":false,"current_user_collections":[],"user":{"id":"_ZfclNUf1Ag","updated_at":"2019-12-06T13:17:55-05:00","username":"cedricletsch","name":"Cedric Letsch","first_name":"Cedric","last_name":"Letsch","twitter_username":null,"portfolio_url":"https://www.cedricletsch.com","bio":"Freelance music photographer & cinematographer.
